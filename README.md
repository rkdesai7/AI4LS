This is some of the code for a project conducted as a part of NASA's AI for Life Science's group. The final paper can be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10719374/.

In this project, the QLattice Machine Learning Model was utilized to identify important changes in gene expression in muscles during spaceflight. Additionally, significant data preprocessing had to occur, and this was implemented using the WGCNA pipeline in R.
